This project is still under heavy development and has not yet had a formal release.
The APIs and code in this project may change in severely incompatible ways while we
redesign components for their presentation-ready form.

End users are advised to not depend on any functionality in this repository until a
release is performed. See [the Kiji project homepage](http://www.kiji.org) to download
an existing release of KijiSchema, and follow [@kijiproject](http://twitter.com/kijiproject)
for announcements of future releases, including KijiREST.

Issues are being tracked at [the Kiji JIRA instance](https://jira.kiji.org/browse/SCHEMA).
